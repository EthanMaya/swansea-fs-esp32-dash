Q: How do I compile/run the code with PlatformIO?

Q: How do I output data to my computer from the esp32-dash when I have canbus plugged in?
A: As far as I'm aware you can't. I have tried for several hours with no luck. If you need to check a data value output it on the screen. This is not the case for the other esp32's so if the screen isn't important try using one of them.

Q: How do I add an issue on Github?
A: Go into the repo that is related to your issue (if none are relevant, make it in overview) and describe the issue. If it's something needing looking at I'll add it into the project chart.

Q: Why doesn't PlatformIO run?
A: If you're filepath has a space in it, PlatformIO will error. If the space is in the name of your user account you will have to make another account without a space. Otherwise, try closing and opening it (do this after installing any extension or doing any download)
